# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-ML
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to detecting brain tumors from MRI scan data. It is an introductory implementation designed to practice image classification, data preprocessing, and evaluation techniques.  The model uses standard image processing libraries to identify the presence of tumors in brain scan images.
